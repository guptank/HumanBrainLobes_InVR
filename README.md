# Presentation of Human Brain in VR Environment
This Blender file was presented at the European Researchers Night 2023. The animation showcases a detailed human brain, derived from the human atlas, within a Virtual Reality (VR) environment.

The animation highlights various regions of the brain, including the frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital, cerebellum, and hippocampus. The camera rotates around the brain, allowing the viewer to observe these different areas coming together. Eventually, the user is transported inside the brain for an immersive experience, visualizing it from within.

## Features
* Human brain model derived from the Human Atlas.
* Highlighted brain regions: Frontal, Temporal, Parietal, Occipital, Cerebellum, and Hippocampus.
* Camera movement: Rotates to reveal different areas of the brain.
* Immersive experience: The user is transported inside the brain for a more detailed view.


## Requirements
To experience the VR environment, the following are required:

* VR headset: To experience the immersive virtual reality visualization.
* Blender with VR addon installed: Blender with VR compatibility for rendering the brain in 3D and enabling the VR view.


## How to Run the Animation
* Set up your VR headset: Ensure it is properly connected to your system.
* Install Blender with VR Addon: Make sure that Blender and the appropriate VR addon are installed.
* Open the Blender File: Load the provided Blender file with the brain animation.
* Activate VR Mode: Using the VR addon, switch the view to VR mode to start the immersive experience.
* press spacebar.

  
## Notes
* The animation is designed for VR but can also be viewed on a standard screen in Blender.
* Ensure that your VR headset is compatible with Blender's VR capabilities for the best experience.


Enjoy the journey into the human brain!
